# Midterm I

## Tasks

- Create CI/CD config which will deploy app only for production branch (no need for real deployment you can just echo something)
- Create small infrastructure with terraform and any cloud provider (AWS, DigitalOcean and etc.). Your infrastructure should contain one instance and database. P.S. AWS and DigitalOcean have a free tier you can use it.
